## FastAPI

FastAPI is a cutting-edge web framework that enables rapid development of APIs with Python. It embraces the latest advancements in the Python ecosystem and leverages type hints to provide an intuitive and efficient development experience. With FastAPI, you can build high-performance APIs with minimal effort, thanks to its asynchronous support and automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation. The framework offers a declarative syntax that allows you to define API endpoints, request and response models, and route handlers using Python functions.

FastAPI's automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation streamline the development process and reduce the potential for errors. Additionally, FastAPI integrates seamlessly with popular Python libraries and tools, enabling you to leverage their capabilities in your API development. Whether you are creating a simple API or a complex microservice architecture, FastAPI empowers you to build scalable and efficient web APIs with ease.

## Swagger and Redoc

Same as for DRF, the Swagger and Redoc interfaces apply for the FastAPI module too:

> FastAPI HotSox Swagger endpoint is currently available while running the containerized application on your local host, at the following link: [http://0.0.0.0/fastapi/v1/docs/]

> FastAPI HotSox Redoc endpoint is currently available while running the containerized application on your local host, at the following link: [http://0.0.0.0/fastapi/v1/redoc/]
